## Usage

To use the OpenStack Clients package, you can import the desired client module and start making API calls. Here's an example:
For most API endpoints you have to authenticate via username/password or application credentials using the `authenticate` method.
Authentication will load the current service-catalog and apply the endpoints to the different clients via service discovery. Only the Keystone has to be configured in the initial config. 


Import as ES Module
```javascript
import OpenStack, { Identity } from "@netzreich/openstack-clients";
import { AxiosError, AxiosResponse } from "axios";
import * as util from "util";

const config = new Identity.Configuration({
  basePath: "{{KEYSTONE_URL}}",

  baseOptions: {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  },
});

const client = new OpenStack(config);
client
  .authenticate({
    auth: {
      identity: {
        methods: ["password"],
        password: {
          user: {
            name: "{{USERNAME}}",
            domain: { name: "{{DOMAINNAME}}" },
            password: "{{PASSWORD}}",
          },
        },
      },
      scope: {
        project: {
          id: "{{PROJECT_ID}}",
          domain: { name: "{{DOMAINNAME}}" },
        },
      },
    },
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Authenticated")

    client.Network.networksGet()
      .then((res: AxiosResponse) => {
        console.log(res.data);
      })
      .catch((err: AxiosError) => {
       console.error(`Failed to get servers: ${err.message}`);
      });
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(`Authentication failed: ${err.message}`);
  });
```
